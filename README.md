# Dart Reduce Method Error on Empty List

This code demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using the `reduce` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce` method requires at least one element in the list to perform the reduction.  Attempting to use it on an empty list results in an error.  The solution demonstrates how to handle this case gracefully.
